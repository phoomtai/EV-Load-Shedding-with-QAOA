# EV load Shedding with QAOA

<h1 style="color: #6b9682;">Welcome to DEF Innovations â€“ Where Quantum Meets Electric Mobility!</h1>


<h2>Quantum Algorithms for Sustainable Electric Mobility</h2>

<p>Our focus is on Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a cutting-edge quantum computing technique. We apply QAOA to tackle the notorious QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem, commonly known as the "knapsack problem" in the context of EVCS. This problem involves optimizing the allocation of electric load to maximize the utilization of charging stations while ensuring the stability of the electric grid.</p>

<h2>Why Quantum Computing?</h2>

<p><span style="color: #6b9682;">Quantum computing</span> offers an unprecedented advantage in solving complex optimization problems like the knapsack problem. Unlike classical computers, quantum computers can explore multiple solutions simultaneously, potentially unlocking solutions that were previously unattainable within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>Our mission is twofold:</p>
<ol>
    <li><span style="color: #6b9682;">Maximizing Electric Load:</span> We aim to use quantum algorithms to maximize the electric load on charging stations, ensuring that they are operating at peak efficiency without overloading the grid. This will reduce charging times, improve user experiences, and ultimately accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.</li>
    <li><span style="color: #6b9682;">Maintaining Electric Stability:</span> Grid stability is essential for uninterrupted power supply and the seamless integration of renewable energy sources. By optimizing the allocation of electric load, we contribute to maintaining the stability of the electricity grid, which is critical for a sustainable future.</li>
